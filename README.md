# Angular Component Communication

The angular component has a great advantage for code modularity, reusability, and managing code. The components need to share data among them. I have implemented three data-sharing processes between components.

1. Parent to Child Component
2. Child to Parent component with @OutPut() decorator
3. Child to Parent Component with @ViewChild() decorator
